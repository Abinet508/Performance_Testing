# Monitoring WordPress site with New Relic

>> Monitoring a WordPress site with New Relic can provide valuable insights into your site's performance and help you identify and troubleshoot issues. Here's a basic overview of how you can use New Relic with WordPress:

* ## Install the New Relic agent

>> The first step is to install the New Relic agent on your server. This is typically done by your hosting provider, but you can also do it yourself if you have access to the server. The installation process varies depending on the server's operating system.

### For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, you can install the New Relic agent using the following commands:
    ```
    export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=true
    export NR_INSTALL_KEY=your-license-key
    wget -O - https://download.newrelic.com/548C16BF.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.newrelic.com/debian/ newrelic non-free" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrelic.list'
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install newrelic-php5
    sudo newrelic-install install
    ```
>> Replace `your-license-key` with your actual New Relic license key. This will enable New Relic for your hosting environment.


### For CentOS/RHEL-based systems, you can install the New Relic agent using the following commands:
    ```
    export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=true
    export NR_INSTALL_KEY=your-license-key
    rpm -Uvh https://download.newrelic.com/pub/newrelic/el5/x86_64/newrelic-repo-5-3.noarch.rpm
    yum install newrelic-php5
    newrelic-install install
    ```
>> Replace `your-license-key` with your actual New Relic license key. This will enable New Relic for your hosting environment.

### For Windows systems, you can install the New Relic agent using the following steps:
    ```
    Download the New Relic agent from the official website.
    Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
    Enter your New Relic license key when prompted.
    ```
>> This will enable New Relic for your hosting environment.


* ## Configure New Relic for WordPress

>> After installing the agent, you need to configure it for WordPress. This involves adding your New Relic license key to your `wp-config.php` file and setting up the New Relic PHP agent. Here's an example of how you can do this:

### Add the following code to your `wp-config.php` file:

``` 
define('NEWRELIC_LICENSE', 'your-license-key');
if (extension_loaded('newrelic'))
{
newrelic_set_appname('your-app-name');
}
```
>> Replace `your-license-key` with your actual New Relic license key, and 'your-app-name' with the name you want to use for your application in New Relic.

### Set up the New Relic PHP agent by editing the `newrelic.ini` file:

```
newrelic.license = "your-license-key"
newrelic.appname = "your-app-name"
```
>> Replace `your-license-key` with your actual New Relic license key, and 'your-app-name' with the name you want to use for your application in New Relic.

* ## View your WordPress site's performance data in New Relic

>> Once you've installed and configured New Relic, you can view your WordPress site's performance data in the New Relic dashboard. This includes information on response times, throughput, error rates, and more. You can use this data to identify performance bottlenecks, troubleshoot issues, and optimize your site for better performance.

* ## Set up alerts and notifications

>> New Relic allows you to set up alerts and notifications based on specific performance metrics. This can help you proactively monitor your WordPress site and address issues before they impact your users. You can configure alerts for things like high error rates, slow response times, and server downtime.

* ## Conclusion

>> Monitoring a WordPress site with New Relic is a powerful way to gain insights into your site's performance and ensure it's running smoothly. By installing the New Relic agent, configuring it for WordPress, and viewing your site's performance data in the New Relic dashboard, you can identify and address performance issues quickly and effectively.

>> If you're looking to optimize your WordPress site for better performance, New Relic is a valuable tool to have in your toolkit. It can help you monitor your site's performance, troubleshoot issues, and ensure a great user experience for your visitors.
